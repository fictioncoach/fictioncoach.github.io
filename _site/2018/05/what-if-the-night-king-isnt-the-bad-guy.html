Oh, and they turn babies into white walkers, to reproduce.</p> <p>That’s the norm with Game of Thrones: all characters have strengths and weaknesses.</p> <p>Like Martin said, he wants to write about the human condition that’s in conflict with itself, at various crossroads in life.</p> <p>And if you come to think of it, that’s what life in a nutshell sounds like.</p> <p><strong>Spoilers ahead,</strong> so if you’ve not watched the series, including season 7, it’d be a good idea to do that first.</p> <p>The show is waiting for its grand finale and many people speculate that the north and the south will eventually rally up behind a common cause: defeat the white walkers.

Here, the Night King, ruler of the White Walkers, turns the newborn baby into one of them, given that that’s the only way they can reproduce.</p> <p>And I feel there might be some drama covering this subject.</p> <p>If only someone could do something about that and forget about the squabbling kingdoms for a while…</p> <p>Given their present air time and portrayal, the white walkers are horrifying monsters, who murder and raise everyone in their path.</p> <p>And as season 8 of Game of Thrones is due next year, 2019, it looks that Jon Snow will put an end to the white walkers, given his and Daenerys’ alliance and their considerable amount of dragonglass.</p> <p>It’s a great if not predictable ending, no matter the possible martyrs and casualties.</p> <h2 id="what-if-its-more-complicated-than-that">What if it’s more complicated than that?</h2> <p>That’s how you create a concept: with a what if question.</p> <p>George Martin has changed the game when it comes to popular fantasy writing, stomping the cliches and usual tropes <sup id="fnref:1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p> <blockquote class="nk-blockquote"> <div class="nk-blockquote-icon">&ldquo;</div> <p>and they're like "oh, he didn't"</p> <div class="nk-blockquote-athr">ERBH - George RR Martin v.

What if there’s more to their reason for invading Westeros?</p> <p>What if there’s something other than “smash, kill and eat brains?”</p> <p>It might be anything from revenge to survival to conquest.</p> <p>And to prove my point, let’s analyze the Game of Thrones universe from their perspective.</p> <p>I know it might be a bit hard, given their air time and even less than scarce material in the books, history and motives, but we have bits and hints and we can look out into the past, way beyond Robert’s Rebellion.</p> <p><strong>Let’s go back to the first men and the children of the forest.</strong></p> <p>We know, thanks to Bran and the wildlings, that the first men and the children of the forest were in conflict for thousands of years, when it came to controlling Westeros.</p> <p>Eventually, both parties agreed to The Pact and took place on the Isle of Faces - <strong>wouldn’t the Faceless men be a great foreshadowing?</strong>.</p> <p>The children received all the forests and the men received pretty much everything else. For this, the men converted to the gods of the forest, which was the religion of the children. Of the forest.</p> <p>Now, everyone was happy. Until the White Walkers arrived.</p> <p>Now, it’s a known myth that these first White Walkers were defeated by the legendary <strong>last hero of the first men.</strong></p> <p>According to that, the last hero and his buddies went in search of the children of the forest, when the long night came, thinking that the children’s magic would protect them from the white walkers.</p> <p>Legend tells us that the last hero was the sole survivor of the combined forces of the giants and white walkers and that he arrived in the children’s camp, <strong>just in time to create a counter-attack.</strong></p> <p>Hence, <strong>the Nights’ Watch was created</strong> and the walkers were defeated. This is what came to be known as <strong>The Battle For the Dawn.</strong></p> <p>After the battle for the dawn, the walkers retreated far north and Bran the Builder, the founder of House Stark, with the help of the children of the forest, built the wall in case the white walkers would ever return.</p> <h2 id="what-about-the-wall">What about The Wall?</h2> <p>Now, we know that the wall most likely has spells involved, not just ice, given that it was built so quickly. And it’s my firm belief that <strong>it wasn’t built by the men and the children.</strong> It’s said that the wall is built with chunks of ice, stacked one on top of the other.</p> <p>Now, <strong>think of the amount of years it would’ve taken the first men, the giants and the children to actually build that wall. Probably hundreds if not thousands of years.</strong></p> <p>We know that the children have access to magic, but their magic is most likely earth aspected.</p> <blockquote class="nk-blockquote"> <div class="nk-blockquote-icon">&ldquo;</div> <p><strong>what if the wall was actually built by, you know, wielders of ice magic?</strong></p> </blockquote> <picture> <source media="(max-width: 991px)" srcset="http://https://fiction.coach/assets/images/posts/resized/mobile/subzero.gif" /> <img class="nk-img-stretch" src="http://https://fiction.coach/assets/images/posts/resized/desk/subzero.gif" alt="subzero.gif" /> </picture> <p><strong>The children of the forest don’t have magic that can manipulate ice.</strong></p> <p>And just in case you’re asking, I don’t know the mechanics of magic.</p> <p>Maybe someone else is more entitled to answer how magic works:</p> <picture> <source media="(max-width: 991px)" srcset="http://https://fiction.coach/assets/images/posts/resized/mobile/youre-a-wizard-harry.jpg" /> <img class="nk-img-stretch" src="http://https://fiction.coach/assets/images/posts/resized/desk/youre-a-wizard-harry.jpg" alt="youre-a-wizard-harry.jpg" /> </picture> <p>The last hero was surrounded by white walkers <strong>before</strong> he reached the children of the forest. Or so the story goes.

Remember Craster’s babies? An alliance between the Starks and the White Walkers.</p> <p>To detail this, we must fast forward a bit to the 13th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch. The Night’s Watch King, not the undead Night king.</p> <h2 id="enter-the-13th-lord-commander-of-the-nights-watch">Enter the 13th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch</h2> <p>The story goes something like this: the Night’s King, the 13th Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, fell in love with a female White Walker and took her as his bride.</p> <p>He named himself the Night’s King and with his bride he ruled for 13 years, enslaving the whole Night’s Watch and offering human sacrifices to the White Walkers.</p> <p>At the end of those 13 years, the Night’s King was defeated by the king beyond the wall, with the help of Brandon the Breaker, king in the north of that time.</p> <p>Now, <strong>there’s a popular belief that the Night’s King was in fact a Stark.</strong> And that his marriage with the female White Walker was in fact <strong>an alliance between the Starks and the White Walkers, as a pact between the undead and the humans.</strong></p> <p>And if you come to think about it, marriages between houses is something quite normal in the world of Game of Thrones.</p> <ul> <li>Sansa is promised to Joffrey,</li> <li>Robb is promised to one of the Frey girls</li> </ul> <p>and so a marriage between a Stark and a White Walker could’ve been a probable strategy to keep the peace between the two houses.</p> <p>As Sansa’s and Joffrey’s marriage didn’t work out, so didn’t the Night’s King.</p> <p>He was killed by Brandon the Breaker and after this, all records of his existence were erased.</p> <p>Now, coming back to Craster’s sacrifices, these human sacrifices to the White Walkers were most likely initiated by the Night’s King and his White Walker bride, from Night Fort, as it’s seen in season 3 that the Night Fort has a hidden passage that leads under the wall. So it would make sense that the Night’s King had his seat there.</p> <p><strong>What if these sacrifices were also part of the pact between the first men and the White Walkers?</strong> Given that the undead White Walkers can only multiply by turning babies and that George Martin has named them</p> <blockquote class="nk-blockquote"> <div class="nk-blockquote-icon">&ldquo;</div> <p>"unborn yet always living."</p> <div class="nk-blockquote-athr">George RR Martin, about the White Walkers</div> </blockquote> <p>Craster was offering his sons and he was spared by the undead. The same thing could’ve happened with the Night’s King: his reasons for making human sacrifices were those of peace.</p> <p>But the Night’s Watch could’ve always been skeptical and thinking that making a pact with eldritch creatures wasn’t such a good game. Especially if one day they could come back and bite you in the ass. Or, you know, kill you. And take the whole of Westeros.</p> <p>The Night’s King’s motives were those of making peace between two worlds.

Worse, <strong>wouldn’t you feel threatened?</strong> Especially since there are three dragons that can put and end to you and your species.</p> <blockquote class="nk-blockquote"> <div class="nk-blockquote-icon">&ldquo;</div> <p>From the moment Daenerys emerged from that fire with three baby dragons, doom was born for the White Walkers: a deadly clash between the worlds of Ice and Fire.</p> </blockquote> <p>A clash that makes Jon Snow the main protagonist.</p> <p>The undead started to raid the north, sometime when Robert Baratheon became king.</p> <p>And Rhaegar’s son, Jon Snow, came into the world. Along with Daenerys and Bran Stark.</p> <p>Jon Targaryen, Bran Stark and Daenerys Targaryen all have soft spots for magic.</p> <ul> <li>Daenerys has her dragons,</li> <li>Bran has his greensight and warging abilities</li> <li>Jon has both warging and an affinity to dragons</li> </ul> <p>Daenerys has fire resistance, given that all true Targaryens have that.</p> <p>On the opposite side, Starks have a possible connection to the White Walkers, given their resistance to cold weather.</p> <h2 id="children-of-the-starks-and-white-walkers">Children of the Starks and White Walkers</h2> <p>Think about the possibility of the Night’s King having fathered children with his White Walker bride. <strong>That would mean that the Starks are half descendants of the White Walkers.</strong></p> <blockquote class="nk-blockquote"> <div class="nk-blockquote-icon">&ldquo;</div> <p>That could explain why the Starks do so well in cold weather and why they tend to be wargs and greenseers.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yes, sidenote, in the books, all the Stark children are wargs, given that all of them can take over their direwolf and go inside its mind.</p> <p><strong>I’m not saying that Starks are actually descendants of the undead or that Targaryens are descendants of dragons, but there are strange things going on in Westeros.</strong></p> <p>And the fact that Jon Snow died to bring peace between the northmen and the wildlings could prove to be a huge foreshadowing for the peace that he could bring between the worlds of Ice and Fire.</p> <p>Quick note, if you want you can <a href="#">learn more about foreshadowing</a>.</p> <p>So as Jon tried once to make the northmen understand that the wildlings are human and persuade all parts that they’re all in the same boat once the White Walkers come, he could play the same part, as an agent of peace between the White Walkers and the Westerosii.</p> <p>But that could mean that the White Walkers and the people from Westeros will unite against Daenerys and her dragons, making her the actual enemy of the whole continent <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p> <p>With Game of Thrones, it’s never an easy ride. More like a sinuous path that forces sinuous bonds and alliances.</p> <blockquote class="nk-blockquote"> <div class="nk-blockquote-icon">&ldquo;</div> <p>So, through his united heritage, of both Stark and Targaryen blood, he'd be the perfect fit to the stereotypical chosen one, to bring peace and save the continent from total annihilation.</p> </blockquote> <p>And that would be one of the reasons why Rhaegar Targaryen, a man fascinated with prophecy, chose to father a son with a Stark woman. Thus, giving birth to the prince that was promised, the true embodiment of the Song of Ice and Fire, giving Westeros the chance to finally know peace.</p> <p>To close this up, I think that the undead Night King is more than simply an embodiment of an abstract threat like death, eternal night and so on. George Martin himself has given clues to that, more than a couple of times.</p> <p>The Night King is just another ruler that wants to see his people live, not only survive.</p> <p>It’d be interesting if the last season has more material on the White Walkers, given that George Martin hasn’t written the last book.</p> <p>But Martin has told us that the ending will be bittersweet and we can only think of so many ways about what that actually means.</p> <p>Will Jon act as the chosen one to save the world and kill Daenerys? Or will the Mother of Dragons succeed in vanquishing the undead and her Westerosii foes?</p> <p>Time can only tell.</p> <p>Thanks for tuning in and sticking this far.
