You can <a href="http://localhost:4000/case-studies">check out my case studies</a>, where I dissect stories from all walks of life.</li> <li><strong>The copy editor.</strong> This is the editor that nurtures your copy and your style. Doesn’t get to touch the story in itself.</li> <li><strong>The proofreader.</strong> This is the person that irons out the last bugs from your writing: spelling, punctuation and formatting.</li> </ol> <p>Not all editors are made equal and while some of them can provide for many of these three functions, not all functions are being taken care of at once. Read <a href="#third-myth">myth no. 3</a> to find out why.</p> <p>Not to mention that besides an editor, you, as the author, will need a book cover designer, a website and a strategy to place your book in front of your readers.</p> <div id="second-myth"></div> <h3 id="2-im-self-published-why-would-i-need-an-editor">2: I’m self-published. Why would I need an editor?</h3> <p>Your loved ones, while honest and caring – traits a good editor <strong>must</strong> have – don’t have the training necessary to spot mistakes. As mentioned earlier, they’d have to know <a href="/2018/06/how-to-write-a-good-story">what a good story sounds like</a>. And know it very well.</p> <p>All the more reason if you’re a self-published author. And a first timer at that.</p> <p>If you’ve published books before, maybe you can chance releasing your book with just a proofread. But otherwise, it’s not recommended.</p> <p>You need someone with a sharp eye for detail and the technical and professional skills. Just like we talked about <a href="#the-professional-editor">the professional editor</a>.</p> <p>That’s, of course, <strong>if you’re serious and you want to sell your story.</strong></p> <div id="third-myth"></div> <h3 id="3-fine-how-do-i-find-an-editor">3: Fine. How do I find an Editor?</h3> <p>You ask for recommendations, like you’d do with finding a dentist or a surgeon.</p> <p>Why is searching for a good editor just like searching for a good doctor?</p> <p>Because cheaper isn’t always better. Just like we talked about it earlier, there are editors and there are editors :)</p> <p>Different skillsets, different mindsets and different levels of professionalism. Just like with anything under the almighty sun.</p> <p>Now, if you don’t have any way of finding an editor through recommendations, browse services like Upwork.com or other freelance platforms.</p> <p>Get some candidates, tell them what exactly you’re looking for (developmental, copy or just proofread) and send samples of your work.</p> <p>After this, you can select the one who asks the best questions and fits your budget and time frame.</p> <div id="fourth-myth"></div> <h3 id="4-ok-ill-work-with-a-developmental-editor-is-my-book-good-to-go-now">4: Ok. I’ll work with a developmental editor. Is my book good to go now?</h3> <p>Maybe.</p> <p>No, I’m not insane.</p> <p>And no, I’m not cheeky either.</p> <p>There were times that I’ve worked with someone for so long on their story, that even I got past the fresh eyes phase.</p> <p>So if you’ve hired me to help you with developmental editing and we’ve spent quite the time on it, I may advise you to employ a copy editor or a proofreader, to iron out any remaining faults in your copy.</p> <div id="fifth-myth"></div> <h3 id="5-the-bastard-makes-stuff-up-whats-with-all-the-markings">5: The bastard makes stuff up.

That’s their job.</p> <blockquote class="nk-blockquote"> <div class="nk-blockquote-icon">&ldquo;</div> <p>That's what you buy: professional judgement.</p> </blockquote> <p>I said judgement, <strong>not criticism.</strong></p> <blockquote class="nk-blockquote"> <div class="nk-blockquote-icon">&ldquo;</div> <p>Critics are those people that come on the battlefield after the war is over and shoot the wounded.</p> </blockquote> <p>You buy the editor’s years of experience. And love of books – <em>see the upcoming first truth.</em></p> <p>But you must also <strong>tell your editor after which style guide you’re taking after.</strong></p> <p>Is it your run-of-the-mill Strunk and White? Is it The New York Times Manual? The MLA?</p> <p><strong>Communication, like in a successful marriage – or a successful brain surgery – is key.</strong></p> <h2 id="the-truths">The truths</h2> <div id="first-truth"></div> <h3 id="1-editors-love-books-and-stories">1: Editors love books and stories</h3> <p>Otherwise, we wouldn’t be editors.</p> <p>There’s also this thing, in which I believe with all my heart:</p> <blockquote class="nk-blockquote"> <div class="nk-blockquote-icon">&ldquo;</div> <p>The more you teach people something, the better you understand it yourself.</p> </blockquote> <p>I had the same experience when I was teaching my friends how to code or when I was showing them how to parry and attack, after a Krav-Maga class.</p> <p>The same happens when I work with an author on their story and teach them the art of storytelling.</p> <p>I fell in love with books from a young age and I’ve been in love with the written word all my life.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/@theplotdude/when-do-you-become-a-mentor-or-the-early-obi-wan-kenobi-c26a0aac27d1">I’ve made mistakes too</a>, in my venture of becoming a professional developmental editor, from a professional programmer.</p> <p>But I’ve always regarded books as carbonated bliss and those people brave enough to write them, as students of truth school.</p> <p>Because that’s the first thing you do, when you decide you’ll write a story: you want to tell your most secret dreams and wishes to the world. And that takes bravery and in turn, bravery means telling the truth.</p> <div id="second-truth"></div> <h3 id="2-they-also-love-working-with-most-authors">2: They also love working with (most) authors</h3> <p>Do you remember when you were a kid and you made friends easily?</p> <p>That’s how an editor feels. He feels like he can make friends like that – snap of the fingers!</p> <p>Just see yourself when you were a kid and remember those times.</p> <p>An editor is a grown-up kid who makes friends on the spot, because he speaks the same language that the author does.</p> <ul> <li>An editor <strong>gets</strong> an author and their needs.</li> <li>An editor <strong>speaks</strong> the same language like the author.</li> <li>And most important of all, an editor <strong>helps you</strong> in your darkest hour: when you’re ready to murder your darlings – that’s lingo for “trim the extra fat and make your story tight.”</li> </ul> <p>Of course, like in any field, a friendship can turn sour and there are some cases in which there’s a disconnect between the two, the author and the editor.</p> <p>In this case, it’s wise you both treat each other with respect and see that you both get what you need: the author gets their manuscript upgraded and the editor gets their money.</p> <p>Sad as it may be, these things happen too.</p> <div id="third-truth"></div> <h3 id="3-a-developmental-editor-is-the-fiction-coach-you-never-had">3: A developmental editor is the Fiction Coach you never had</h3> <p>Like I said earlier, you want to tell your truth to the world.</p> <p>You want to share whatever it may be that you’ve learned, either through a painful experience, or a happy coincidence that later turned out it wasn’t coincidence, it was just your years of careful planning and scheming – just kidding.</p> <p>You’re in it for the story, the retelling of what you want the world to know from you.</p> <p>Maybe you know how to do that, after so many years – like Stephen King does – or maybe you need help. That’s the help professional editors give you: raw efficiency.</p> <p>They are your partners in crime, so to speak.</p> <p>And <strong>a good editor will be there for</strong> you, helping you with
